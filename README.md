## **How to prepare**

(1). Cut the lemon in half and then into thin half-moon slices.
(The best lemons to make caipirinha are those with smooth and thin rind.)

(2). Lightly muddle (smash) the lemon slices with the sugar in a lowball glass 
(Too much macerating makes the drink bitter).

(3). Fill the glass with ice and add the cachaça. Mix and finish with lemon slices.
